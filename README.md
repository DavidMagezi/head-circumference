# head-circumference

## Description

This code presents a method to automatically estimate the head-circumference of a fetus from ultrasound images in the ["standard"] plane. It utilises a deep-neural network (U-Net architecture). Importantly, there are no explicit shape constraints built-into the model (see for example Bohlender et al 2022).
