# head-circumference

## Description

This code presents a method to automatically estimate the head-circumference of a fetus from ultrasound images. It utilises a deep-neural network with [U-Net] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-Net). Importantly, there are no explicit shape constraints built-into the model (see for example Bohlender et al 2022).
