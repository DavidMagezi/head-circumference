# head-circumference

## Description

This code presents a method to automatically estimate the head-circumference of a fetus from ultrasound images. It utilises a deep neural network with a [U-Net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-Net) architecture. Importantly, there are no explicit shape constraints built-into the model, which is in contrast to the methods reviewed by [Bohlender and colleagues (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07721).
